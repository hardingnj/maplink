# maplink

Simple python utility for creating symbolic links

## installation

`maplink` is available at Pypi; and can be installed using `pip` or `pipx`. It is lightweight with only standard library
dependencies. 

```bash
python3 -m pipx install maplink
```

However, if you have `uv` installed; it is recommended to run directly using `uvx`:

```bash
uvx maplink source target
```
